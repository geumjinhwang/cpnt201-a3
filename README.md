## Summary 
There is three different colors of stars and vivid star for desktop turns into pastel star in mobile version. I used **stroke** property for both of stars to enhance the design and separate from the background. SVG files are located in "svg" folder and optimized version of the graphic have a viewBox, prettify Markup is turned on and precision is reduced to 1.
